## What is Dart ? 

Dart is a general-purpose, high-level modern programming language developed by Google. It is used to build applications for the web, mobile, and desktop.
Dart is an **object-oriented** language. 

It has a C-style syntax, which means that it is similar to languages like Java, C#, and C++, moreover it can also be compiled to JavaScript, allowing Dart code to run on any modern web browser

Some important features include, Null safety, async programming and automatic garbage collection. 


It has two type of compilation technique 
1. Just in Time Compilation (JOT) : 
   - What ? Convert the byte code in machine code (native code)
   - Help by compiling only those part which is being run by machine, thus providing feature of hot reload. 
2. Ahead of Time Compilation (AOT) :
   - What ? It converts the dart code in the optimized JavaScript code using dar2js compiler and run in all modern browser
   - Helps by compiling the code, to be deployed in prod environment or to app-store etc. 


## Why Dart ?

Learning Dart can provide many benefits for a programmer like:
1. Used to build applications for the web, mobile, and desktop using single codebase using flutter
2. Dart has a **strong type system**, which can help to prevent common programming errors and make your code more reliable.
